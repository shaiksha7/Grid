            <blockquote> Competitive Programming:</blockquote>
            Scott Wu appears to be a highly skilled programmer based on his profiles on platforms like:
            The Competitive Programming Hall of Fame <a
                href="https://cphof.org/profile/topcoder:scott_wu">(https://cphof.org/profile/topcoder:scott_wu)</a>
            lists his participation and achievements in various coding competitions.
            Codeforces <a
                href="https://codeforces.com/profile/scott_wu">(https://codeforces.com/profile/scott_wu)</a>shows
            his profile with a user rating, indicating his participation in the platform's coding challenges.
            This suggests a strong foundation in computer science and problem-solving skills honed through
            competitive programming.
            Possible Involvement with Cognition:

            There's a possibility Scott Wu is involved with a company called Cognition, based on a LinkedIn profile
            result <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wu-scott">(https://www.linkedin.com/in/wu-scott).</a> However,
            details about the company and his specific role are
            scarce.
            Cognition itself is known for its work in AI reasoning <a href="https://medium.com/tag/cognition">(source:
                https://medium.com/tag/cognition),</a> so if
            Scott Wu is indeed connected to the company, his achievements might lie in the realm of AI development or
            research.
            Uncertainties Remain:

            Due to the lack of definitive information, it's difficult to confirm Scott Wu's exact professional path or
            his specific contributions to Cognition
